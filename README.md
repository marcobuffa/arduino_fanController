## ToDo:

- [x] Get requirements
- [x] Find a good idea
- [x] Find hardware (also super powerful and dangerous stuff)
- [x] Write some basic code
- [x] Debug
- [ ] Add some interesting features (GSM communication, fan-safe maximum activation time, ...)
- [ ] Debug again
- [ ] Test in real environment 
- [ ] Write a meaningful documentation
- [ ] Enjoy your new, moisture-free, garage :-)
